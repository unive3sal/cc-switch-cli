The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.8.4] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Providers / ClaudeAPI**: Add the ClaudeAPI sponsor preset, logo, and README sponsor copy, with a Claude-only base URL preset at `https://gw.claudeapi.com`.
- **Codex / Sessions**: Add the upstream-aligned unified Codex session history toggle. When enabled, official Codex subscription sessions can share the `custom` provider bucket with third-party providers, with backup-backed migration and restore support. The setting remains off by default.

### Changed

- **Provider / Live Config**: Merge live provider config updates safely instead of overwriting unrelated local changes, preserving app-specific semantics across Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Hermes, and OpenClaw. [#283](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/283)
- **OpenCode / Providers**: Preserve and edit provider-level `modalities`, including image-capable provider config blocks. Fixes [#241](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/241). [#285](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/285)
- **TUI / Proxy Settings**: Align proxy listen-port editing with active workers so app-specific ports can be changed while other app proxy workers are running. [#270](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/270)

### Fixed

- **Auth / Codex OAuth**: Run `cc-switch auth login` polling sleeps inside the Tokio runtime, fixing the `there is no reactor running` panic while waiting for device authorization. Fixes [#271](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/271).
- **Proxy / OpenAI Compatibility**: Strip unsupported `cache_control` fields during Anthropic-to-OpenAI conversion, omit `tool_choice` when no tools are sent, and handle truncated Codex chat streams without masking incomplete responses. Closes [#257](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/257). [#262](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/262)

## [5.8.3] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **Database / WebDAV**: Raise the supported SQLite schema to v11 so CLI installs can open and sync databases created by the newer CC Switch line. Fixes [#281](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/281).
- **Database / Backups**: Tighten file permissions for the cc-switch database and backup files, including migration and recovery paths.
- **Release Notes**: Keep the generated release body focused on assets and update metadata while GitHub renders the contributor list.

### Fixed

- **Database / Migration**: Add the v10 -> v11 migration for `proxy_request_logs.pricing_model` and the expanded `usage_daily_rollups` key with `request_model` and `pricing_model`.
- **WebDAV / Import**: Accept current-schema v11 sync exports instead of treating them as future databases, while still rejecting schemas newer than this build before restore work starts.
- **Usage Logs**: Preserve the request model and pricing model dimensions when usage rows are rolled up or restored from sync snapshots.

### Commits (since v5.8.2)

- f620fd3b Secure cc-switch database and backup file permissions (#221)
- 663174ff chore(release): simplify release notes body

### Thanks

- Thanks `@Lei-fly` for opening [#281](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/281) and spelling out the v5.8.2 to schema v11 compatibility failure.
- Thanks `@FeiYehua` for the database permission hardening and the schema v11 compatibility work in [#221](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/221).

- Thanks to every contributor who has worked on CC Switch CLI, reported issues, reviewed changes, tested releases, or helped users diagnose upgrade problems.

## [5.8.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Providers / RunAPI**: Add a RunAPI sponsor preset for provider creation in the CLI and TUI, with matching README sponsor details.
- **CI / Benchmarks**: Add a benchmark workflow and a blocking release benchmark gate so release tags fail before publishing if key TUI paths regress.
- **Release Notes**: Enable GitHub-generated release notes so published releases show the Contributors section with avatars.

### Changed

- **TUI / Performance**: Improve startup responsiveness, provider refresh, and route-opening paths, with benchmark coverage for the flows that were tuned.
- **Benchmarks / CI**: Stabilize benchmark provider selection, fail-fast behavior, and threshold reporting for release and CI runs.
- **README / Release Metadata**: Refresh the README version badges for 5.8.2.

### Fixed

- **Codex / Reasoning Cache**: Restore cross-turn reasoning context for `custom_tool_call` and `tool_search_call`, matching the existing `function_call` handling and fixing missing reasoning errors from Kimi/Moonshot and DeepSeek. Fixes [#258](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/258). [#263](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/263)
- **Codex / Model Catalog**: Write `model_catalog_json` as the relative file name `cc-switch-model-catalog.json`, matching Codex's own catalog references and keeping configs more portable. Fixes [#260](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/260). [#265](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/265)
- **Codex / Sessions**: Scan `archived_sessions/` alongside active Codex sessions so archived sessions appear in the TUI and CLI session browser. Fixes [#260](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/260). [#265](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/265)
- **Proxy / Daemon**: Preserve daemon worker runtime status when proxy state is refreshed.
- **TUI / Tests**: Isolate header layout tests so UI assertions do not leak state between cases.

## [5.8.1] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Codex / TUI**: Add a managed Codex OAuth accounts page under Settings, with account listing, details, login actions, and a persistent login toast that requires confirmation before cancellation.
- **Codex / DeepSeek**: Add an upstream-aligned DeepSeek Codex preset for CLI and TUI provider creation, including model catalog entries for `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro`, reasoning metadata, icon metadata, and the expected Codex TOML shape. Fixes [#250](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/250).
- **Providers / TUI**: Add provider badges and detail labels for proxy requirements, localized as `Needs Proxy` / `No Proxy Support` and `需要代理` / `不支持代理`.
- **Docs / Agents**: Add root `AGENTS.md` instructions for Codex and other coding agents.

### Changed

- **TUI / Hot Refresh**: Route fast refreshes through read-only snapshot state so background app-data, usage/pricing, quota, proxy, skills, and OpenClaw provider reads do not silently write or repair persistent state.
- **Docs / README**: Refresh README positioning around dual TUI/CLI workflows, managed ChatGPT/Codex OAuth accounts, session history, token/cost usage statistics, and OpenAI-compatible proxy routing.
- **Docs / Maintenance**: Prune stale design notes, old release-note drafts, and refactor plans from `docs/`, keeping the published changelog mirrored under `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **README / Release Metadata**: Refresh the README version badges for 5.8.1.

### Fixed

- **Codex / Chat Bridge**: Build Codex Responses-to-Chat bridge URLs from the configured provider base URL instead of forcing `/v1`, fixing DeepSeek proxy requests that should go to `/chat/completions`. Fixes [#242](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/242).
- **Codex / Auth Docs**: Clarify that 5.8.0 introduced managed-account plumbing, while the 5.8.1 TUI account page is the first user-facing Codex OAuth account-management screen.
- **TUI / Snapshot Reads**: Avoid clearing invalid runtime session state, creating default proxy rows, rewriting default cost multipliers, persisting OpenClaw live-only providers, or clearing invalid current-provider settings during snapshot-only refreshes.

## [5.8.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- **Usage Statistics / TUI**: Add a dedicated Usage Statistics page in the main TUI, with day/month/custom ranges, overview metrics, a trend chart, cache hit-rate display, model/provider/request-log tabs, and non-blocking loading for slow usage and pricing queries. Fixes [#230](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/230).
- **Model Pricing / TUI**: Add Model Pricing as a child page under Usage Statistics, with recent usage context, inline editing through Enter, deletion support, and cost backfill when pricing becomes available.
- **Usage Analytics / Database**: Add SQL-backed usage aggregation, daily rollups, model pricing storage, request-log cost recovery, and session usage import paths for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode.
- **Codex / Local Routing**: Expose Codex local routing configuration in the TUI, including API format metadata, model mapping, model fetching, add/delete/edit support, and upstream-aligned persistence. [#235](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/235)
- **Codex / Auth**: Improve managed-account plumbing for Codex provider flows, including safer token handling and live model fetching when a provider already carries a managed-auth binding. Full Codex official multi-account management remains tracked separately.
- **Providers / CLI**: Add provider shortcut commands, provider start dry-run support, live config commands, provider quota commands, additive provider-key prompts, provider add templates, editable provider duplication, and one-off model fetching.
- **App Config / CLI**: Add settings commands, config directory open commands, OpenClaw config commands, and provider configuration flows for OpenClaw, Hermes, and OpenCode.
- **Proxy / Protocols**: Add Codex Chat routing, Gemini native protocol conversion, GitHub Copilot provider support, Copilot model normalization, managed Copilot auth, and Copilot request optimization.
- **Sessions / TUI**: Add session message filters and improve session spatial navigation. [#214](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/214)
- **TUI / Help**: Add contextual help overlays for provider fields, Usage Query, Codex Local Routing, proxy details, and global help. [#237](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/237)

### Changed

- **TUI / Performance**: Move app-switch data loading and usage/pricing refreshes onto async worker paths, keeping normal app switching responsive while heavy usage SQL and pricing SQL run in the background.
- **Update / Homebrew**: Improve Homebrew update handling and refresh README installation guidance. [#219](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/219)
- **Tests / CI**: Split unit and integration test loops, isolate filesystem state during parallel tests, and add CI coverage for the expanded test set. [#232](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/232)
- **README / Release Metadata**: Refresh the README version badges for 5.8.0.

### Fixed

- **Proxy / Read Tool**: Drop empty `pages` arguments from streamed and non-streamed `Read` tool payloads before forwarding them, covering the argument snapshot delta path as well as complete tool calls. [#217](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/217)
- **Proxy / OpenAI Compatibility**: Inject `stream_options.include_usage` where needed, canonicalize OpenAI tool payloads, preserve merged system cache control, preserve redacted thinking placeholders, and normalize native Anthropic tool-thinking blocks.
- **Proxy / Codex Compatibility**: Align Codex proxy auth preservation, request header guards, encoding handling, upstream chat SSE fallback, provider identity migration, and Responses-to-Chat bridging.
- **Provider Config Preservation**: Preserve Claude API key fields, Codex settings siblings, and Gemini settings siblings when editing or switching providers.
- **Provider Templates**: Align Codex sponsor template `apiFormat` metadata between CLI seeding and the TUI serializer. [#238](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/pull/238)
- **Database / Usage Logs**: Repair request-log schema state before creating usage indexes so older databases can upgrade cleanly.
- **TUI / Usage**: Tighten usage overview spacing, keep cache hit-rate and trend visuals readable across small terminals, stabilize custom range loading, and remove stale shortcut text from nested usage pages.

## [5.6.1] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **Proxy / Upgrade Compatibility**: Clean up trusted legacy managed proxy sessions before daemon startup and avoid rebinding daemon-known worker ports, fixing proxy enable failures after upgrading from the pre-daemon proxy runtime. Fixes [#200](https://github.com/SaladDay/cc-switch-cli/issues/200).

## [5.6.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Proxy / Daemon**: Add a daemon-managed proxy process for CLI and TUI proxy workflows, including worker startup, status checks, restart handling, and shutdown commands.
- **Proxy / Apps**: Add per-app proxy workers and default listen ports so Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini can run through separate local proxy endpoints.
- **Usage Query / TUI**: Add the TUI Usage Query configuration page with upstream-aligned templates, field visibility, validation behavior, and result display.
- **Prompts / CLI / TUI**: Move prompt management onto the SQLite prompt service, add prompt identity editing, and confirm before importing over existing prompt files.
- **Codex / Config**: Add `CODEX_HOME` support for Codex installations outside the default config directory.
- **TUI / Editing**: Add readline-style text editing and normalize vim-style navigation across forms and overlays.

### Changed

- **Proxy / Database Compatibility**: Keep the database schema at v10 and store CLI-only proxy preferences in the settings KV entry `proxy_preferences_cli_only`, preserving upstream/WebDAV database compatibility.
- **Proxy / Process Safety**: Replace process-name matching with daemon-owned worker tracking and status proof before stopping existing proxy workers.
- **Provider / Common Config**: Align common config snippets, editor reuse, confirmation flow, Codex extraction, and CLI commands across provider workflows.
- **TUI / Providers**: Refine provider actions, provider empty states, failover proxy UX, Skills page layout, footer shortcuts, and space-toggle behavior.
- **README / Release Metadata**: Refresh the README version badges for 5.6.0.

### Fixed

- **WebDAV / Sync**: Avoid upload readback checks that could fail in compatible WebDAV environments.
- **Database / Compatibility**: Improve the future-schema error path so newer databases fail clearly instead of being modified by older binaries.
- **Failover / Tests**: Stabilize failover proxy setup coverage around the updated proxy workflow.

## [5.3.4] - 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **README / Release Metadata**: Refresh the README version badge for 5.3.4, remove the README patch-highlight section entirely, and link the About section directly to the changelog for release details.

### Fixed

- **WebDAV / Restore**: Keep restore flows from clobbering device-local proxy runtime state and sync active prompt files back into live app directories after restore/download paths.
- **Database / Sync**: Accept upstream schema v10 databases through staged `v8 -> v9 -> v10` migrations, keep WebDAV `db-v6` compatibility intact, refresh the upstream pricing catalog, and create a pre-migration backup before startup upgrades.
- **MCP / Database**: Preserve upstream Hermes MCP enablement when synced databases are loaded and saved locally, so round-tripping MCP entries no longer clears the v10 compatibility flag.
- **Temp Launch / CLI**: Fix temporary-launch model setting switches, align Codex custom defaults and validation, and lower the shell completion activation barrier for the updated command flow.

### Commits (since v5.3.3)

- 8a2a850 Preserve temporary provider launches without leaking native CLI control
- 94c2b13 Trim patch-note links from the README release summaries

- Thanks `@aldev814`, `@Hatiaa`, and `@hitsmaxft` for the earlier migration reports that continued to inform the database compatibility follow-up.

## [5.3.3] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- **Update / Startup Gate**: Allow `cc-switch update` to bypass startup database initialization so older installed binaries can still self-update even when the local database schema is newer than they support.

### Commits (since v5.3.2)

- 43a952b (update) allow self-update to bypass startup database gates

### Thanks

- Thanks `@saladday` for closing the self-update blocker and pushing the startup-gate fix across the finish line.
- Thanks `@huanghuoguoguo` and `@KKfhfv` for the recent provider and CLI iteration that helped surface and pressure-test this patch cycle.

## [5.3.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added

- **Providers / CLI**: Add `provider export` so Claude provider settings can be exported to a standalone `settings.local.json` path with either the default project-local destination or an explicit output override.
- **Sponsors / Presets**: Expose DDS as a sponsor entry and one-click preset in the provider template flow.

### Changed

- **Rust / CI**: Pin the Rust toolchain to 1.91.1, align release builds to the same compiler baseline, and add a dedicated Rust CI workflow that enforces `cargo fmt --check`.
- **README**: Carry the current patch highlights forward to 5.3.2 by updating the README version badge and `What's New` title without rewriting the existing section body.

### Fixed

- **Codex OAuth / Backend**: Keep managed multi-account Codex OAuth token resolution, provider-bound account routing, and quota lookup aligned in the backend request path.
- **Provider / CLI**: Remove the temporary `provider usage` query command path so the CLI surface stays clean and the Rust fmt CI gate no longer fails on that code path.

### Commits (since v5.3.1)

- c0b370b (auth) preserve Codex OAuth account isolation across provider requests
- b2b0ebc (build) pin Rust formatting and compiler checks to a reproducible baseline
- bad1d44 Feat/issue 97 provider export (#110)

- Thanks `@saladday` for the Codex OAuth backend alignment, release hardening, and DDS preset work that rounded out this patch release.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- **README / Release Notes**: Refresh the README patch highlights for 5.3.1 and add dedicated patch release notes for this release.

### Fixed

- **Codex / Provider Editing**: Preserve official Codex auth snapshots during provider edits and avoid recreating official providers as third-party endpoint configs.
- **Database / Import**: Accept schema v8 databases, add the v6 -> v7 -> v8 migration path, and keep corrected pricing data aligned between migrated and newly created databases.
- **Proxy / Provider Switching**: Update the active proxy target immediately while takeover is running so provider switches no longer require a manual proxy restart to take effect.

### Commits (since v5.3.0)

- c0a01ec fix(proxy): switch running proxy targets without restart (#95)
- b18e8b7 fix(database): support schema v8 imports and staged migrations (#106)
- 81cd431 fix(codex): preserve official auth snapshots during provider edits (#102)

## [4.2.8] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- **Providers**: The “Official provider” add mode is now Codex-only (Claude Code uses third-party flow only).
- **Codex (Official provider)**: Skip prompts for website URL / model / wire API; uses `requires_openai_auth = true` and `wire_api = "responses"` by default.

## [4.2.2] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- **Interactive**: The common config snippet editor now uses the same external editor flow as provider JSON editing (opens your `$EDITOR` via external editor). Fixes #11.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- **Interactive**: Add a JSON editor in `⚙️ Configuration Management → 🧩 Common Config Snippet` to edit/apply per-app common config snippets (Claude use-case: shared env like `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`). Fixes #11.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- **Common Config Snippet**: Add `cc-switch config common` to manage per-app common config snippets (useful for shared Claude settings like `env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` and `includeCoAuthoredBy`). Fixes #11.

### Changed

- **Claude**: Merge the common config snippet into the live `~/.claude/settings.json` when switching providers.
- **Claude**: Strip values matching the common snippet when backfilling provider snapshots, so common settings stay global across providers.

## [4.1.4] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- **Providers (Interactive)**: When adding the first provider for an app, auto-set it as the current provider (prevents “current provider is empty” and unlocks switching). Fixes #10.

## [4.1.3] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

- **Codex (0.63+)**: Avoid writing `env_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"` into `~/.codex/config.toml` by default (prevents `Missing environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY`).
- **Codex**: Generate provider config using `requires_openai_auth = true` for OpenAI-auth flows; interactive provider add/edit now lets you choose auth mode.
